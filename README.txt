The Mystery

A game where I am testing JS functionality and learning to make simple puzzles. 
The game has different html-pages and different js pages to manage them. 

Now the game has 2 pages, and the second page is my favorite, especially
the sun puzzle.

Here is the link to the page:

Things to add:

-toggle music
-better logic to the game itself, how to make user to connect right hints
