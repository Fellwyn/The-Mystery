This project was created during early phase of my JS journey and
nowadays I use different approach to structures, styling and overall JS functionality]** <br><br>

A game test where I was learning JS functionality and how to make simple puzzles. 
The game has multiple HTML pages, each managed by separate Javascript file. 




#### Things to add:

- toggle music
- better JS logic in the background
- better and more logical hints
- Bootstrap
